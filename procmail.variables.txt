# It is essential that you set SHELL to a Bourne-type shell if
# external commands are run from your procmailrc, for example if
# you use rc.spamassassin, rc.quarantine, or other advanced recipes.
# Setting SHELL should not be needed for the simple sorting recipes in
# this step-by-step section, but to be safe and to future proof your
# procmailrc, set it anyway! Details are in Check Your $SHELL and $PATH.
SHELL=/bin/sh

# Directory for storing procmail configuration and log files
# You can name this variable anything you like, for example
# PROCMAILDIR, or don't set it (but then don't refer to it!)
PMDIR=$HOME/.procmail.d

# LOGFILE should be specified ASAP so everything below it is logged
# Put ## before the next line if you want no logging (not recommended)
LOGFILE=$PMDIR/procmail.log

# To insert a blank line between each message's log entry in $LOGFILE,
# uncomment the next two lines (this is helpful for debugging)
## LOG="
## "
LOG="--- Logging ${LOGFILE} for ${LOGNAME}, "

# Set VERBOSE to yes when debugging; VERBOSE default is no
## VERBOSE=yes

# Replace $HOME/Msgs with the directory where your personal (non-system-spool) mailboxes reside.
#
#    * Mailboxes in maildir format or served by Courier IMAP are often in $HOME/Maildir
#    * Mailboxes served by UW IMAP are sometimes in $HOME, sometimes in $HOME/mail, & sometimes elsewhere
#    * MAILDIR default is the value of $HOME
#
# Make sure that $MAILDIR exists and that it is a directory!
MAILDIR=$HOME/Maildir/

# IMPORTANT:
# * On most systems $MAILDIR is a subdirectory of $HOME
# * Upon reading a line that contains MAILDIR=
#     Procmail does a chdir to $MAILDIR
#      ...and $MAILDIR becomes the Procmail working directory
#       ...and relative paths are relative to $MAILDIR
# * Do not include a trailing slash in your MAILDIR setting
# * The $MAILDIR directory must exist and must be writable by your LOGNAME
# * The MAILDIR variable is an entirely different entity from maildir mailbox format
